                              writes fiction and lots of code. He once penned a poem about an eagle soaring high above
                              the world’s injustices. He was 16, so you know it was as awesome as it sounds. Brad’s fiction
                              has been published in <span class="italics">Yellow Chair Review</span> and Pittsburgh’s <span class="italics">City Paper</span>, and he is at work on
                              a novel about a strip club in small-town West Virginia. Visit his website at

                        writes fiction and spends more time in pool halls than he probably should. Mike
                        once wrote a poem about his cat, Coconut; even at the age of eight he had a flair for alliteration.
                        His first novel, Once in a Blue Year, is available on Amazon. His second novel has been “almost done”
                        for two years; the title changes monthly. Find him online at
