<h3>Brad Coffield</h3><p>Brad Coffield writes fiction and lots of code. He once penned a poem about an eagle soaring high above the world’s injustices. He was 16, so you know it was as awesome as it sounds. Brad’s fiction has been published in Pittsburgh’s City Paper and Yellow Chair Review, and he is at work on a novel about a strip club in small-town West Virginia.

<h3>Mike Durkota</h3> <p>Mike Durkota writes fiction and spends more time in pool halls than he probably should.
