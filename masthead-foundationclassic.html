                                    writes fiction and lots of code. He once penned a poem about an eagle soaring high above
                                    the world’s injustices. He was 16, so you know it was as awesome as it sounds. Brad’s fiction
                                    has been published in Pittsburgh’s City Paper and Yellow Chair Review, and he is at work on
                                    a novel about a strip club in small-town West Virginia. Visit his website at

                                    writes fiction and spends more time in pool halls than he probably should. Mike
                                    once wrote a poem about his cat, Coconut; even at the age of eight he had a flair for alliteration.
                                    His first novel, Once in a Blue Year, is available on Amazon. His second novel has been “almost done”
                                    for two years; the title changes monthly. Find him online at
