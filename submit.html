        <h2>Submit to genre2</h2><p>
            Genre2 accepts fiction, creative nonfiction, poetry, visual art, graphic narrative, and other genres that we’re not hip enough to think of at the moment. If it’s not your main gig, we want to read it.</p>

                We’re currently putting together our first issue, due out Summer 2018. Beginning with our second issue, we invite submissions from all writers interested in testing their limits. To submit, please send 3–6 poems, fiction or nonfiction of 7500 words or less (flash welcome!), or up to 10 images to genre2@gmail.com.

                Simultaneous subs welcome, though please send only one submission at a time. We aim to respond to all work within two months.
