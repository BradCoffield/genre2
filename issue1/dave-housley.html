bio: <span class="author-bio-name">Dave Housley</span> is the author of the novel <span class="italics">This Darkness Got to Give</span> and four story collections, most recently <span class="italics">Massive Cleansing Fire</span> and <span class="italics">If I Knew the Way, I Would Take You Home</span>.

He's one of the founding editors and all around do-stuff people at <span class="italics">Barrelhouse</span>.

    Fiction. Short fiction is the one that I feel like I know how to do the best and that's probably just because I've worked at it more than anything else. Currently I'm working on a novel but wouldn't say that I exactly know how to write one of those very well.

    I had been thinking about an idea for a poem based on the phrase "ancient alien theorists believe," which is a common refrain on the show <span class="italics">Ancient Aliens</span>. It's easy to be cynical and jokey about it, but I had an idea about a young "ancient alien theorist" working alone early in the morning, and really believing, and struggling with the fact that most of his colleagues and the rest of us in the world kind of look at that as a joke. I love the show <span class="italics">Ancient Aliens</span> and there's a moment in most of them where it kind of slides—for me, at least—from presenting a fairly persuasive argument that maybe there was something more to a story to being a kind of loopy free-associative linked collection of random conspiracy theories. We always joke that <span class="italics">Ancient Aliens</span> is never more than one anecdote away from Nazis or the Denver Airport (so many questions about the Denver Airport!). I kind of wanted this to slide around in that way but eventually tip toward earnestness.

    Editing. Also, I think I'm kind of a hokey poet. It's hard to edit out the hokey-ness, if that makes any sense. Much harder in a poem, for me, than in a short story, where I feel like I naturally edit any tendency toward earnestness or hokey-ness very early in the process, so the resulting story doesn't bear much of that initial impulse toward sentimentality or over-simplification or I'll just go ahead and write hokey-ness again. I thought it was really interesting how much harder it was to edit myself and those tendencies in a poem than a story. I feel like a lot of writing is just hard work and experience so I attribute the fact that I can do that in a story better than a poem to the fact that I've written so many more stories. Still, it was really eye opening how hard it was to apply the things that I've learned to do in fiction to another genre. Thanks for the chance to do that!

            <span class="poem">
    The ancient astronaut theorist believes <br>
    there is a chance the Egyptians had help from the sky. <br> 
    He believes those flying cars in the Ramayana <br>
    are more than translation errors. <br>
    The ancient astronaut theorist believes <br>
    it is folly, hubris, pomposity <br>
    to accept that you can know we are alone <br>
    in the unknowable universe. <br>
    <br>
    The ancient astronaut theorist believes <br>
    the Syfy producer when she says <br>
    they are looking for a new Giorgio, <br>
    a younger Giorgio, a Giorgio for the millenials. <br> 
    The ancient astronaut theorist believes the Syfy producer <br>
    but wishes she would use the word “Giorgio” less <br>
    when she tells him about her wishes. <br>
    <br>
    The ancient astronaut theorist believes <br>
    his appearance on the one about Shiva the Destroyer <br> 
    did not do him any favors with the department,  <br>
    even though he was careful to point out <br>
    that no scientific evidence exists <br>
    to indicate that Shiva really was an alien leader <br>
    who brought advanced technology to earth, <br>
    or that her third eye was not a third eye <br>
    but a raygun that shot fire out of her forehead. <br> 
    The ancient astronaut theorist believes <br>
    still that it defies both logic and history <br>
    to imagine they could have carved the entire Kaisana Temple <br> 
    out of a single piece of rock, <br>
    twelve hundred years ago. <br>
    <br>
    The ancient astronaut theorist believes <br>
    the other adjuncts are calling him <br>
    Shiva the Destroyer. It is not <br>
    a compliment, far from a compliment <br>
    and still-- <br>
    a single piece of rock? <br>  
    Twelve hundred years? <br>
    It is unfathomable, folly, hubris. <br> 
    It is his curse and his gift: <br>
    he can fathom it only one way. <br>
    <br>
    The ancient astronaut theorist believes <br>
    these Wheaties are becoming stale, <br>
    have become stale, are stale. <br>
    He believes the boiler <br>
    will need to be replaced. <br>
    Diapers are so expensive. <br>
    The Discover bill is due in three days. <br>
    <br>
    The ancient astronaut theorist believes<br>
    he hears the baby stirring upstairs, <br>
    the birds singing, cars driving, <br>
    the baby cries her primitive cry. <br>
    <br>
    The ancient astronaut theorist believes.
