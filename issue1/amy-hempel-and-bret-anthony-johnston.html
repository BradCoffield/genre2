                That’s not going to read as a horse, she said.<br>
                I misunderstood—I thought I was feeling pain—<br>
                arch neck, high tail, long croup, sixteen hands<br>
                and first bred: Arabian,<br>
                nervous horse—I taught her a name she didn’t know.<br>
                When danger approached, she<br>
                sang to it in a<br>
                language she had not yet learned.<br>
                Gandhi could do this, no need for a<br>
                salt march. The salt on skin enough,<br>
                skin ready to take the stain of Sumi ink.<br>
                Our Lady of Reparations<br>
                apprenticed on prisoners,<br>
                on generals, on their wives<br>
                in Okinawa—right out of the gate, so to<br>
                speak, of any group of animals she had ever seen.<br>
                The weather in the canyon,<br>
                the words in her run, her blood<br>
                needing commemoration<br>
                not in pasture, not in paddock,<br>
                not traditional pen and stylus<br>
                but on the backs of soldiers,<br>
                in the lines of a poem she—<br>
                I, we—<br>
                never once divined to write.<br>
