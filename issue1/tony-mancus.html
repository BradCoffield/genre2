interview_1: >
    Poetry, in large part because that's what I started with and have done the most. And because it's how I process the world and think, or the closest approximation to this. I love stories, though, but have a hard time building the components of them and maintaining the focus they require. With poetry, spilling language and finding what's there afterwards is doubly rewarding for me—you get the catharsis of getting things out and the puzzling wonder of piecing things together.

    Honestly, I didn't know what to do while Shannon was in for surgery for endometriosis. And Christ, that condition—so many women are being clobbered by it and there's so little research being done—emblematic of women's healthcare in general. If men had super painful tissue from their reproductive organs growing randomly on and in other organs, they'd have both a pain outsourcing program constructed and nanotreatments for the tissue growth in the middle of last century. Bah. Rant aside, I've been drawn toward the lyric essay structure for a while and just non-fiction in general and while in the waiting room decided to try and document what was going on in as truthful a fashion as I could in part so I wouldn't freak out and also to try and capture the common condition of waiting in worry.
interview_3: >
    I think just being consistently honest, or aiming for "objective" truth in an experience. I'm much more accustomed to trying to capture images and hinting at experience through images, but this was an inversion of that, I think, but I also think that some of what I'm used to doing in poems helped me to arrange things here. And honestly, I think the genre lines have become and maybe always were more porous than lines let on, so it was good to kind of realize that again.
