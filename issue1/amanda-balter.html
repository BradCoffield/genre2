interview_1: Academic writing. I feel the safest within the bounds of a thesis statement.
interview_2: The need to express something rather than argue a point, as I would in a piece of academic writing. 
interview_3: I was surprised to find that the craft of poetry is equally, if not more, particular than academic writing. While there is undoubtedly freedom within the genre, the art of perfecting a line, choosing the word with the best sound, mastering the overall rhythm, etc. was both challenging and satisfying. I found the more I worked with poetry, the more my academic writing excelled. Poetry teaches the importance of the details—something I’m not sure I could have learned without exploring this genre.

                SADNESS IS LIKE SICKNESS, IT GETS WORSE AT NIGHT
            </h2>
            <span class="poem">
                in the morning when a heart thud wakes me up<br> the memories say good morning, beautiful<br> your face might
                as well be red blood cells<br>running the entire hellish system<br> but the mind is exempt<br> the mind
                is not affected by the time<br> of day the routine of sunlight<br> the mind is a rabid animal<br> only the
                immunized can fight<br> i’ve trained this animal<br> with daily shots<br> not to pay<br> attention to<br>                the
                rise &amp;<br> fall of<br> sadness
                <br>

            <h2 class="piece-title">Sorrow</h2>
            <span class="poem">
                “The real world doesn’t care <br> about our spiritual conditions,<br><br> just asks that we be well enough <br> to smile at its clamor,” the poet said.<br><br> Diamonds are gemstones <br> but do they always
                shine?<br> to my thoughts. The sun<br><br> yawns only when<br> the moon sleeps.<br><br>
                <span class="italics">Can you give a better explanation?</span><br> No.
                <br><br> The cactus thorns thrive<br> in the lion’s mouth. I’m hungry<br><br> for orchids. <span class="italics">
                    Water with rosewater<br> three times a day.
                </span><br><br> Too much, too many, no.<br> These weeds flourish<br><br> between neurons—<br> no, they grow
                at night<br><br> with the moon<br> before the sun wakes.
            </span><br><br>
