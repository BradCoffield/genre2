        SADNESS IS LIKE SICKNESS, IT GETS WORSE AT NIGHT
    </h3>
    in the morning when a heart thud wakes me up<br>
    the memories say good morning, beautiful<br>
    your face might as well be red blood cells<br>
    running the entire hellish system<br>
    but the mind is exempt<br>
    the mind is not affected by the time<br>
    of day the routine of sunlight<br>
    the mind is a rabid animal<br>
    only the immunized can fight<br>
    i’ve trained this animal<br>
    with daily shots<br>
    not to pay<br>
    attention to<br>
    the rise &amp;<br>
    fall of<br>
    sadness<br>
    
    <h3 class="piece title">Sorrow</h3>
    “The real world doesn’t care <br>
    about our spiritual conditions,<br><br>
    just asks that we will be decent enough <br>
    to smile at its clamor,” the poet said.<br><br>
    Diamonds are gemstones <br>
    but do they always shine?<br>
    to my thoughts. The sun<br><br>
    yawns only when<br>
    the moon sleeps.<br><br>
    <span class="italics">Can you give a better explanation?</span><br>
    No.<br><br>
    The cactus thorns thrive<br>
    in the lion’s mouth. I’m hungry<br><br>
    for orchids. <span class="italics">
        Water with rosewater<br>
        three times a day.
    </span><br><br>
    Too much, too many no.<br>
    These weeds flourish<br><br>
    between neurons—<br>
    no, they grow at night<br><br>
    with the moon<br>
    before the sun wakes.<br><br>
