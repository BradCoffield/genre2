    Fiction. Probably because it’s what I came to first. Beyond that, I don’t know why, but it’s where I feel the most free, where I feel the widest range of possibilities.

    This poem arose as part of a sequence addressing both suicide and the Old Testament. Specifically, though, it was generated by an experience: I was walking on the beach and I came across, rather mysteriously, a severed deer’s leg. This actually happened to me several times over a month or two and it was hard not to read it as meaningful; and yet, what did it mean? For whatever reason, maybe because I had been writing a lot of poetry about the difficulty of reading and interpreting warnings and omens, about the sign’s meaning being inextricable from its indecipherability, I associated this event with the poems I’d been working on. But if I’m honest, these are topics that always interest me, so why did this one announce itself as a poem rather than a story? I’m not sure. My guess is that while this poem is about a lot of things, it quickly connected the deer’s leg with my incomprehension in the face of a friend’s suicide, but this connection is emotional, purely associative—one mystery recalls another—and poetry welcomes this kind of strange correlation of inner and outer experience.

    The different register shifts, in this poem--from lyrical to vulgar, introspective to colloquial and back—were a little tricky to manage without much explanation. I was looking for a transition or transformation of register and diction that feels both dramatic and natural and maybe even funny. In this poem I found, also, that I didn’t need to explain the references to Jonah, Nineveh, and Jonah’s gourd, though I did need the movement between references, memories, and experiences to feel organic and intimately related to the first essential experience—finding the leg.
