    Fiction. Probably because it’s what I came to first. Beyond that, I don’t know why, but it’s where I feel the most free, where I feel the widest range of possibilities.

    This poem arose as part of a sequence addressing both suicide and the Old Testament. Specifically, though, it was generated by an experience: I was walking on the beach and I came across, rather mysteriously, a severed deer’s leg. This actually happened to me several times over a month or two and it was hard not to read it as meaningful; and yet, what did it mean? For whatever reason, maybe because I had been writing a lot of poetry about the difficulty of reading and interpreting warnings and omens, about the sign’s meaning being inextricable from its indecipherability, I associated this event with the poems I’d been working on. But if I’m honest, these are topics that always interest me, so why did this one announce itself as a poem rather than a story? I’m not sure. My guess is that while this poem is about a lot of things, it quickly connected the deer’s leg with my incomprehension in the face of a friend’s suicide, but this connection is emotional, purely associative—one mystery recalls another—and poetry welcomes this kind of strange correlation of inner and outer experience.

    The different register shifts, in this poem--from lyrical to vulgar, introspective to colloquial and back—were a little tricky to manage without much explanation. I was looking for a transition or transformation of register and diction that feels both dramatic and natural and maybe even funny. In this poem I found, also, that I didn’t need to explain the references to Jonah, Nineveh, and Jonah’s gourd, though I did need the movement between references, memories, and experiences to feel organic and intimately related to the first essential experience—finding the leg.

         <span class="poem">
            In the morning I find the deer’s leg:<br>
            hooved and whole and severed<br>
            from the body, though the body<br>
            has disappeared, or been taken, or never was.<br>
            I’m on the shore, another morning walk<br>
            to claim what the tide allows.<br>
            I was thinking: sea glass, a perfect purple<br>
            oyster shell, driftwood stained with salt.<br>
            Instead: this wild fucking gore—<br>
            flies buzzing around the red meat,<br>
            the wet fur gone gray as the felt<br>
            on the pool tables at the bar<br>
            where we met first.<br>
            You died on this day, last year,<br>
            but won’t stop washing up:<br>
            a photo slips from a book,<br>
            your pink toothbrush rattles in a drawer,<br>
            last week I was writing poems about Jonah<br>
            who would not answer the call<br>
            and, I kid you not, I found notes<br>
            I never knew you took in the belly of my bible.<br>
            Yesterday, I tried to tell the girl I met at the dock<br>
            about you and how I, like Jonah, let the phone ring.<br>
            I walked here with her at sundown<br>
            in the grove of broken pines<br>
            under the cliff and, though I tried<br>
            to be actual, everything I said was steeped<br>
            in the nimble beauty of loss. Wait for it—<br>
            this too is less lovely than it sounds:<br>
            we fucked against a pine tree<br>
            with a trunk stunted by wind,<br>
            too thin to hold with more than one hand,<br>
            while questions rose like gulls:<br>
            can I slap the mosquito that lands<br>
            on her ass? In other words,<br>
            when Keats wrote, O for a life<br>
            of sensations rather than of thoughts—<br>
            this is probably not what he meant,<br>
            but he could trip over the deer’s leg<br>
            and find the light of poppies<br>
            in the wound’s empty mouth<br>
            while I came to the shore for something<br>
            like this—sudden weather, the sensual<br>
            life again—and though in the long term<br>
                         it didn’t mean much, we made a fire<br>
            and sat against a rock, drank the last<br>
            two beers and watched the black trees<br>
            shiver against the black sky; we were at ease<br>
            in each other; if we were not whole<br>
            at least we were not measuring<br>
            what we had lost. Listen to me—<br>
            I claim impermanence, I claim<br>
            what the tide allows:<br>
            the beautiful thing you tossed away<br>
            like a bottle into the sea, your life<br>
            a thin stone you couldn’t keep skipping,<br>
            your memory<br>
            a hard flat rock the gulls break clams against,<br>
            and your body gone,<br>
            gone as the deer’s, eroded, unscavenged,<br>
            whole as Jonah’s gourd<br>
            before the maggot came.<br>
