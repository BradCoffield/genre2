                Okay. Say you typed “attack!” <br>
                That part of the summer, <br>
                those brief weeks, jumped alive. <br>
                A boom of carpenters, waitresses. <br>
                That summer rolls enough to wreck <br>
                the town.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tide <br>
                would move. Everyone remained. <br>

<span class="poem">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned in, <br>
    took off. Mixing <br>
    already in the mirror— <br>
    her face her bath herself her teeth. <br>
    The bedroom pulled back her eyes, <br>
    her eyes as he approached. <br>

    <span class="poetry">

The complication of authority <br>
that arrival, the long day. <br>
Find the tooth. Go through <br>
it all in darkness: <br>
come back, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turn home, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clean up. <br>
