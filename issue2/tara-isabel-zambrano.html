interview_1: Flash fiction because that's how I think, framing sentences from images, unraveling a story. It's fun, challenging, and deeply satisfying to convey a human condition in a few words.
interview_2: I used to write poetry before I started writing flash. I came back to it so my flash fiction is sharper, cleaner. Writing a poem, to me, is more of a cerebral labor than fiction is. It make me think/see things, characters, the universe in a focused light. 
interview_3: Getting the rhythm and the structure right. The sharp, stinging details. The need of expression rather than arriving at a conclusion. Reading it ten days later, and feeling the shiver down the spine.

                A summer stretched too long. Barren hours <br>
                splinter under our feet. Jet streams <br>
                <br>
                make a crossword puzzle. Bored weathermen fill the grid <br>
                with clear skies. There is no water for grass to grow. <br>
                <br>
                Celebrities bury their DNA on the moon, blue <br>
                like ours. Light years away, the rings <br>
                <br>
                of Saturn disintegrate deep oceans into dark matter.<br>
                I hear you sleep talkâ€”calling time<br>
                <br>
                a traitor, always leaving us dry. On a hot, bright day, <br>
                we go for a swim and sing <span class="italics">Star Wars</span>. Urge <br>
                <br>
                each other to fly.<br>
