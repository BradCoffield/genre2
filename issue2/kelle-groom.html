interview_1: Poetry. It slows me down. I like to stay in the moment, and really look around. Poetry helps me to pay attention.
interview_2: The subject - student debt and repayment - has been a crushing weight in my own life. It feels ruinous. In reading about the effects of student debt on others,  I was outraged. So much of what I read - students being pursued for repayment after death, families "ruined" because they couldn't repay student debt, etc - seemed from an unreal, dystopian future. It felt impossible to write about this subject in poetry or memoir. But there was the possibility of freedom in fiction, that I could be as dark and satiric as necessary to get at the truth of  an insane situation that went far beyond by own personal experience.
interview_3: I was surprised by the way my obsessions - poverty, debt, land ownership, factories, the almshouse - looped into this story. I was surprised that in using restraint in writing scenes that were unbearable and made me furious, they could be funny. Maybe funny isn't the right word, but there can be sharpness/wit, and that made the piece a pleasure to write. Setting the story slightly in the future was also freeing - to be in a kind of timeless world that hadn't happened yet.
