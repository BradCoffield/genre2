interview_1: Poetry is my preferred genre although it's hard to offer an explanation because that suggests this preference is logic-driven and that is only partially true. Much of my engagement with poetry is driven by intuition and a desire to engage with dreaming logic rather than waking logic. That said, I also love the formal qualities of poetry and the challenge of working within conventional or invented forms; it is the pleasure of matching a bouquet with the perfect vase. 
interview_2: "Portrait of a Losing Bet" began when I was a resident at the Vermont Studio Center...in 2011 (yes, I've been working on this story for eight years). While I can't remember exactly what conversation or interaction initially triggered the story, I can say that one of the things I loved best about the Vermont Studio Center was the chance to engage with visual artists--to visit their studios, to learn about their processes. This engagement motivated me to create the character of Clarice (the artist in the story) as well as to explore the idea of story as a form of portraiture. 
interview_3: As implied in my response to the previous question, one of the challenges for me is simply in finishing a piece of short fiction. I easily get paralyzed with insecurity and doubt when writing fiction; plots terrify me (as does dialogue and conflict and basically anything that makes something a story and not a poem). However one of the surprising gifts of working on this story is that each time I returned to it I still liked something about it; that kinship compelled me to move beyond my insecurities and try to finish it rather than let it fester alongside the rest of my incomplete fiction.
