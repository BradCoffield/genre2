interview_1: Academic writing. I feel the safest within the bounds of a thesis statement.
interview_2: The need to express something rather than argue a point, as I would in a piece of academic writing. 
interview_3: I was surprised to find that the craft of poetry is equally, if not more, particular than academic writing. While there is undoubtedly freedom within the genre, the art of perfecting a line, choosing the word with the best sound, mastering the overall rhythm, etc. was both challenging and satisfying. I found the more I worked with poetry, the more my academic writing excelled. Poetry teaches the importance of the details—something I’m not sure I could have learned without exploring this genre.
